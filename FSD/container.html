    <DIV CLASS="container">"Truth is not something outside to be discovered, it is something inside to be realized." 
        Here's a deeper look at some of Osho's most impactful quotes:
        On Being:
        "Be - don't try to become" 
        "The real question is not whether life exists after death. The real question is whether you are alive before death." 
        "Listen to your being. It is continuously giving you hints; it is a still, small voice." 
        "Be the person you are. Never try to be another, and you will become mature." 
        On Fear and Freedom:
        "Life begins where fear ends." 
        "If love cannot give freedom, then it is not love." 
        On Love and Relationships:
        "Friendship is the purest love." 
        "When you love, love as if the person is a god, not less than that." 
        "Millions of people are suffering: they want to be loved, but they don't know how to love." 
        On Meditation and Awareness:
        "Meditation is the only answer to all the questions of man." 
        "Meditation is just to be, not doing anything--no action, no thought, no emotion. You just are and it is a sheer delight." 
        "Start becoming more and more a witness. Whatever you do, do it with deep alertness; then even small things become sacred." 
        On Truth and Reality:
        "Truth is not something outside to be discovered, it is something inside to be realized." 
        "You exist in time, but you belong to eternity." 
        Other Notable Quotes:
        "If you love a flower, don't pick it up. Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love." 
        "Tomorrow may cancel this day completely." 
        "Disturb them, shock them. Hit them hard! Give them challenges! That challenge will bring their capacities to the climax!" 
        "I love to disturb people." 
        "Body is the visible soul, and soul is the invisible body." </DIV>
